# Native Packager

This is a small experiment to enable creating standalone executables from any folder structure,
by providing a shell command to be used as an entry point. Currently the project works,
but many improvements are required to make it actually useful.

# To Do

* Unix file permissions/other metadata (for now this can be emulated using gzip)
* Windows support without cross compilers
* Documentation
* Testing
